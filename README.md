# Todo-list-Node.js

In this project I did a Todo list only using Node.js,
It's a very good exercice to work on the exchanges of datas and the MVC environment.
I used express, ejs, mongoose and nodemon on this project.

# To see the project.

You simply have to clone the repository then
run 'npm install' for the dependencies and 'nodemon index.js' to run the project.
Have a good day !
